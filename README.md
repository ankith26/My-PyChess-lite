# My-PyChess Lite

This repo is based on [My-PyChess](http://github.com/ankith26/My-PyChess) application.

This is "lite", it does not contain all fancy features of My-PyChess like a GUI with too many menus, singleplayer, online etc etc etc ..................

It is just plain and simple chess under 350 lines of code - Although it still supports all chess features like move validation, check-checkmate-stalemate detection, pawn promotion, castling and enpassent.

It is perfect for programmers who want to look at the basics of a chess app.
